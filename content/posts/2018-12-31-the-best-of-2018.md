Last year I was thinking about to make **this experiment where I should pick the top moments of the year**. Finally, I didn't do it and I was desiring to do it this year. This exercise **helps me to be more aware of the positives things and be grateful for them**.

- I ran approximately **600 km**. If we look at a Spain map (it's not a too big country), between Madrid and Barcelona there's 619 km. I almost can do the entire journey.
- I ran my first marathon. Those 42 kilometers were really hard, but I could finish it in **4 hours and 7 minutes**. Someday I'll have to improve that mark.
- I listened **39.224 minutes of music**. That means around 27 days listening to music non-stop. Thanks Spotify!
- I read **12 books**. If you want to know more about what I'm reading, go to my [Goodreads profile](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/90000857-alberto-gallego).
- I always believed that remote working is the present and the best way to work for me. 6 months ago I started **working remotely**. And I love it.
- **I moved from Barcelona to Seville** to spend more time with my family. For the next year, I want to move further away.
- Professionally, **at Colvin I've learned more this year than all the previous ones**. We did a lot of things together this year and also we had time to do two trips: Bulgaria and Galicia.
- For my girlfriend's birthday, we visited **Slovenia**. We didn’t expect too much of this country, but **we fell in love with it**. We were thinking of living there for a while.

- Thanks to Vueling's mistake, **I could flight to Vienna for 1 cent**.
- I visited some places in my country that I always like to return to: Valencia, Toledo, Galicia and Granada.
- I've been for the **first time in South America**. My first destination was Peru. It's an incredible country, with a lot of diversity. One day you can be in the desert and the other one in the jungle.
- After Peru, I visited Mexico. I was lucky to spend **"Día de Muertos" in Pátzcuaro**, away from tourism. It was incredible being there to celebrate that day.
- I visited **two Wonders of the World in one year**: Machu Picchu and Chichen Itzá.
- I've taken **30 flights**. I love traveling, and I'm so lucky to be able to discover the world. It's something I'm really grateful for.
- I came back to Italy. This time I visited **Verona and Venice**. As always, it's a pleasure to return here. I'll never get tired of this country.

- I'm passionate about gastronomy. So to conclude this list, I'll share with you **my top 5 restaurants in this year**:

1. [Seledonia's Mesa](https://goo.gl/maps/hAiz8uLtPhQ2) (Cusco, Perú) → I miss a lot the typical family restaurant where you can eat home-made food. If you are in Cusco, you can enjoy the Peruvian gastronomy here. Everything we tasted there was delicious.
2. [Recomiendo](https://goo.gl/maps/3fzynNN55zM2) (Córdoba, Spain) → Quality food for an affordable price (36€). The whole experience is worth to try, at least one time. Don't miss the "Perikadas".
3. [Bar Ludeña](https://goo.gl/maps/ucjQT9D1HwR2) (Toledo, Spain) → If you want to eat typical Spanish food, this place is wonderful. Don't forget to order "pisto" with codfish.
4. [Gostilna Trost Jožica Trost s.p.](https://goo.gl/maps/b4XBdj5u7QC2) (Rodik, Slovenia) → We found this place by accident. The owner was really friendly and the food (mostly seafood and pasta) was incredible.
5. [Chez Albert](https://goo.gl/maps/1himEHESXyQ2) (Brugge, Belgium) → If you are there, you must try the best waffles in the world. That's all.

I hope you spent a really nice year, full of discovering, learnings and good memories. I wish you the best for the next one!
