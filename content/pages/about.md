Hi! My name is Alberto. Nice to meet you. I was born in the south of Spain, in a beautiful city called CÃ³rdoba. It would be hard for me to identify with something in particular, so I prefer to tell you **what I'm doing right now**.

I work remotely for Colvin, a Barcelona startup, as Frontend Developer. Also, I am **offering my services as a freelance** for those who want to make their idea a reality or improve their business.

The thing I enjoy the most of my job is seeing how an idea growth, evolve and become reality. That's why **one of my goals is to live by my own ideas**, to make them a reality and to evolve according to my values and the things I truly believe in.

I love to travel, to be in movement and to know the world that surrounds us. **My dream is to visit every country in the world**, and so far I have been able to visit more than 21.

I'm a big fan of **gastronomy**. I think **one of the best ways to connect with the people** or country you are visiting is through their food.

I consider myself **minimalist**. Years ago **I stopped wanting to have more** to want to have just what I need. 

In my blog, I'll tell you what I'm learning and the reflections I'm doing along this way.
